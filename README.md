This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) based implementation of the augmented Îµ-constraint (AUGMECON) method and its variants which can be used to solve multi-objective optimization problems, i.e., to return an approximation of the exact Pareto front.

It currently supports:

- Inner loop early exit (AUGMECON)
- Bypass coefficient (AUGMECON2)
- Flag array (AUGMECON-R)
- Processs-based parallelization

[GAMS implementations](#useful-resources) of the method and its variants were provided by the authors of the papers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available [Python](https://www.python.org/) implementation.

## Installation

PyAUGMECON can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) using `pip install pyaugmecon`. Detailed installation instructions for both [Anaconda](<#anaconda-installation-(advised)>) and [PyPI](#pypi-installation) installations are available below.

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle)
- [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/)
- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (other sovlers supported as well)

> The [Gurobi Python bindings](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_mac/cs_python.html) are significantly faster than using the executable. So even if you have already installed Gurobi, please still install the Python version for an optimal experience.

### Anaconda installation (advised)

This installation is advised as the PyPI installation of Gurobi does not include the licensing tools. Only Gurobi needs to be installed as other tools are by default included in Anaconda or will be automatically installed as dependencies of PyAUGMECON.

```bash
# Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com

# Install Gurobi
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
conda install gurobi

# Install PyAUGMECON, and dependencies
pip install pyaugmecon
```

### PyPI installation

For a PyPI installation, only Gurobi needs to be installed, other requirements will automatically be installed as dependencies of PyAUGMECON. As mentioned above, the PyPI version of Gurobi does not include licensing tools, see [Gurobi documentation](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-) on how to install these.

```bash
# Install Gurobi, PYAUGMECON, and dependencies
pip install gurobipy pyaugmecon
```

### Other solvers
The installation instructions above describe an installation with Gurobi, since this is the solver that has been used for testing. However, other solvers should work as well. The only requirement is that the solver is supported by Pyomo. An example of the GLPK solver can be found [in the test folder](https://github.com/wouterbles/pyaugmecon/blob/main/tests/ga/test_two_objectives.py).

## Usage

First, an optimization model generator function needs to be created to pass the model to PyAUGMECON. This function should return an unsolved instance of the optimization problem, see [Pyomo model](#pyomo-model). Essentially, the only difference in comparison with creating a single objective Pyomo optimization model is the fact that multiple objectives are defined using Pyomo's `ObjectiveList()`.

The rest of the process is automatically being taken care of by instantiating a `PyAugmecon()` object and solving it afterward with `PyAugmecon.solve()`.

### PyAugmecon parameters

Instantiating a `PyAugmecon(model, opts, solver_opts)` object requires the following parameters:

| Name          | Description                                                                                             | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `model`       | Function that returns an unsolved instance of the optimization problem, see [Pyomo model](#pyomo-model) | Yes      |
| `opts`        | Dictionary of PyAUGMECON related options, see [PyAugmecon options](#pyaugmecon-options)                 | Yes      |
| `solver_opts` | Dictionary of solver (Gurobi) options, see [solver options](#solver-options)                            | No       |

### Example 3kp40

The following snippet shows how to solve the `3kp40` model from the `tests` folder:

```python
from pyaugmecon import PyAugmecon
from tests.optimization_models import three_kp_model

# Multiprocessing requires this If statement (on Windows)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_type = "3kp40"

    # AUGMECON related options
    opts = {
        "name": model_type,
        "grid_points": 540,
        "nadir_points": [1031, 1069],
    }

    pyaugmecon = PyAugmecon(three_kp_model(model_type), opts)  # instantiate  PyAugmecon
    pyaugmecon.solve()  # solve PyAugmecon multi-objective optimization problem
    sols = pyaugmecon.get_pareto_solutions()  # get all pareto solutions
    payoff = pyaugmecon.get_payoff_table()  # get the payoff table
    decision_vars = pyaugmecon.get_decision_variables(sols[0])  # get the decision variables
```

### PyAugmecon solutions details

The solutions are stored in the `sols`, `unique_sols`, and `unique_pareto_sols` attributes. These differ in the following ways:

- `sols` contains all solutions, including duplicates and non-Pareto solutions
- `unique_sols` contains all unique solutions, including non-Pareto solutions
- `unique_pareto_sols` contains all unique Pareto solutions

The solutions are stored dictionary, where each dictionary contains the objective values (keys) and the decision variables (values). The objective values are stored as a tuple, where the first element is the objective value of the first objective function, the second element is the objective value of the second objective function, and so on. The decision variables are stored as a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the decision variables and the values are the values of the decision variables.

This is an example of the `unique_pareto_sols` attribute:

```python
{
    (3, 5): {'x': pd.Series([1, 2]), 'y': pd.Series([2, 3])},
    (4, 4): {'x': pd.Series([3, 4]), 'y': pd.Series([1, 2])},
    (5, 3): {'x': pd.Series([2, 4]), 'y': pd.Series([1, 3])},
}
```

### PyAugmecon options

### Solver options

To solve the single-objective optimization problems generated by the AUGMECON method they are passed to Gurobi, an external solver. All [Gurobi solver parameters](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/parameters.html) can be passed to Gurobi with this dictionary. Two parameters are already set by default, but can be overridden:

| Option      | Description                                                                                          | Default |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `MIPGap`    | See Gurobi documentation: [MIPGap](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/mipgap2.html)     | `0.0`   |
| `NonConvex` | See Gurobi documentation [NonConvex](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/nonconvex.html) | `2`     |

### Pyomo model

A multi-objective Pyomo model is similar to a single-objective model, except that the objectives should be defined using Pyomo's `ObjectiveList()` and attached to the model by an attribute named `obj_list`. Multiple example models can be found in the `tests` folder and a simple model can be found below:

```python
def two_objective_model():
    model = ConcreteModel()

    # Define variables
    model.x1 = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)
    model.x2 = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)

    # --------------------------------------
    #   Define the objective functions
    # --------------------------------------

    def objective1(model):
        return model.x1

    def objective2(model):
        return 3 * model.x1 + 4 * model.x2

    # --------------------------------------
    #   Define the regular constraints
    # --------------------------------------

    def constraint1(model):
        return model.x1 <= 20

    def constraint2(model):
        return model.x2 <= 40

    def constraint3(model):
        return 5 * model.x1 + 4 * model.x2 <= 200

    # --------------------------------------
    #   Add components to the model
    # --------------------------------------

    # Add the constraints to the model
    model.con1 = Constraint(rule=constraint1)
    model.con2 = Constraint(rule=constraint2)
    model.con3 = Constraint(rule=constraint3)

    # Add the objective functions to the model using ObjectiveList(). Note
    # that the first index is 1 instead of 0!
    model.obj_list = ObjectiveList()
    model.obj_list.add(expr=objective1(model), sense=maximize)
    model.obj_list.add(expr=objective2(model), sense=maximize)

    # By default deactivate all the objective functions
    for o in range(len(model.obj_list)):
        model.obj_list[o + 1].deactivate()

    return model
```

## Tests

To test the correctness of the proposed approach, the following optimization models have been tested both using the GAMS and the proposed implementations:

- Sample bi-objective problem of the original paper
- Sample three-objective problem of the original implementation/presentation
- Multi-objective multidimensional knapsack (MOMKP) problems: 2kp50, 2kp100, 2kp250, 3kp40, 3kp50, 4kp40 and 4kp50
- Multi-objective economic dispatch (minimize cost, emissions and unmet demand)

These models can be found in the **tests** folder and run with [PyTest](https://pytest.org) to test for the correctness of the payoff table and the Pareto solutions. Example: `pytest tests/test_3kp40.py`

## Notes

- The choice of the objective function(s) to add as constraints affects the mapping of the Pareto front. Empirically, having one of the objective functions with a large range in the constraint set tends to result in a denser representation of the Pareto front. Nevertheless, despite the choice of which objectives to add in the constraint set, the solutions belong to the same Pareto front (obviously).

- If X grid points in GAMS, X+1 grid points are needed in PyAUGMECON in order to exactly replicate results

- For some models, it is beneficial to runtime to reduce the number of solver (Gurobi) threads. More details: [Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/threads.html)

## Known limitations

- For relatively small models (most of the knapsack problems), disabling `redivide_work` and `shared_flag` should lead to slightly lower runtimes. This is due to the overhead of sharing the flag array between processes that don't have a shared memory space. Redividing the work results in additional models solved with duplicate solutions, leading to longer runtime. By sharing the flag array in a different way and dividing the work more smartly these limitations might be solved in the future.

- To parallelize the solution process, the grid is divided into blocks with a minimum length of the inner loop (number of grid points) over the processes. With fewer than three objectives, there is only one dimension to iterate over, and as such no parallelization possible. This is something that can be improved in the future.
